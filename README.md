# salt-tests

This repo contains a set of saltstack (https://saltstack.com) states, modules and extensions that I used to learn salt

It basically defines and configures a server using pillar values

environment: proxy, locale, timezone, hostname, network, sshd, certbot (if asked)
basic services: syslog, fail2ban, auditd (enhanced rules), aide, nrpe/prometheus clients/exporters (if needed)
                postfix, snmp
services already 

Just to push
